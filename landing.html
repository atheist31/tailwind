          Ernesto Guevara de la Serna, also known as Che Guevara, was an Argentinean-born Cuban revolutionary leader who became a left-wing hero. He was born on 14 June 1928 in Rosario, Argentina, into a middle-class family. Guevara studied medicine at Buenos Aires University and travelled widely in South and Central America. His interest in Marxism convinced him that the only solution to South and Central America's problems was armed revolution.
